# PortfolioV3

This is the latest portfolio I have created for myself.

## Created with:

React, Typescript, TailwindCSS

## Fun thing that I had to do:

Had to find a way to make the react router work buy adding the 404.html page thingy from another developer and then adding my own fix with the ?/projects on the home page and ?/projects on the router.
